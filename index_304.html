<h1>COMPX304 Mini-Internet Project</h1>

<p>
This website hosts some of the debugging resources for the mini-Internet assignment.
These tools are similar to those deployed on the real Internet.
You can find the assignment itself and other resources on the course Moodle page.
</p>


<h2>Route Tables (Looking Glass)</h2>
<p>You can access the routes that every router on the mini-Internet Access here: <a href="looking_glass">looking glass</a><br />
These are ordered by AS number then router name. For example, the Tier1 AS 1 routes for HAML are here: <a href="looking_glass/G1/HAML.txt">looking_glass/G1/HAML.txt</a></p>

<h2>Connectivity Matrix</h2>
<p>The connectivity matrix actively probes reachability within the mini-Internet. It shows which ASes are reachable from others.<br />
You can access the connectivity matrix here: <a href="matrix/matrix.html">matrix/matrix.html</a></p>

<h2>Connection List</h2>
<p>The list of links connecting ASes, the relationship with the AS on the link, and the addresses to use on that link.<br />
Access here: <a href="as_connections.txt">as_connections.txt</a></p>

<h2>BGP Analyzer</h2>

<p>
This tool shows if an AS is following the correct policy with
its announcements over the IXP.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note: This tool only detects incorrect announcements, not
	missing announcements. If you are not sharing any routes
	over BGP your configuration is incorrect, but this tool
	won't detect that case. It doesn't guarantee that your
	configuration is correct.</b>
